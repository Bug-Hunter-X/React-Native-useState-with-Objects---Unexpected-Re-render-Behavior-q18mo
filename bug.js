This error occurs when using the `useState` hook in React Native with an object as the initial state.  If you try to update only a property within that object, React Native might not re-render the component as expected. This is because React's shallow comparison only checks if the reference to the object has changed, not the contents of the object.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [myState, setMyState] = useState({ count: 0, name: 'Initial' });

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setMyState({ ...myState, count: myState.count + 1 }); //Incorrect Update
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {myState.count}</Text>
      <Text>Name: {myState.name}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
